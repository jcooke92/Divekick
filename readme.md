This project was assigned in the Fall 2016 Game Art & Animation class taugh by Joowon Kim at the University of Houston.

Our team was tasked with creating 2D mobile game by the end of the semester. 

We created a game plan and ran with it. We had many inital ideas but the concept of a simple infinite runner/action game stuck. 

Some of the obstacles our team faced:

- implmenting procedurally generated terrain
- fine tuning the physics to work correctly (especially the collision detection)
- making graphic effects show correctly 

Our team ended creating a simple yet challenging game. There's two actions the player can perform, which each use a single button press, and there's only one goal: to accumulate as many points as quickly as possible.

Divekick was judged by several professional video game developers, and most of the criticism came from the lack enemy variation, unpolished graphics and little end game challenge.

However, we received endless praise for a light-hearted game that presents players with simple, yet fun and cohesive game mechanics. 

There's plenty of room for improvement, but for now this project is closed for modification.
